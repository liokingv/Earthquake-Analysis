# Earthquake-Analysis

This was my midterm project for my Data Science Tools and Programming course (Winter 2022). It was required to pick a dataset based on complexity points so as to tackle the data wrangling aspect of the project and to come up with three moderately complex questions and answer them. Data visualization of at least one question was an additional requirement. 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards program offers earthquake data on their website. For the purpose of answering all three questions, three separate data sets had to be obtained in order to capture all earthquakes that registered a magnitude of 2.5 and above. The first dataset captured smaller earthquakes of (magnitude 2.5+), the second captured larger earthquakes (magnitude 4.5+) and the third captured significant earthquakes. The period of record for all three datasets ranged over the last 30 days. The date range for the dataset is from early January 2022 to early February 2022. 

The questions of interest explored the relationships between earthquake magnitude and location, magnitude/depth/intensity, and patterns of frequency. 

There are three files in the repository. Two files are python code and correspond to the data wrangling and the data visualization aspect. The third file is a report of my findings in the OSEMN report format. Please note that the data used for the report will be different from the one you will collect should you run my code. The USGS API specifically provides the most recent 30-day data.
